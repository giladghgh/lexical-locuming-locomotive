# Gilad's Thesaurus Engine
### My attempt at a (nonsensical) synonym replacement program.

Or the *Lexical Locuming Locomotive*, as it likes to call itself.

The `Thesaurus-Engine.exe` code differs to the original source code slightly. The source is a bit less... polished, so traverse that with care and read the commenting.

When you run the executable `Thesaurus-Engine.exe`, you have two options:
###### 1) Use the code you've pasted into `input.txt`. To do this enter "file" (no quotes) when prompted for text. This is useful for larger text.
###### 2) For smaller text, just paste directly into the command line.
