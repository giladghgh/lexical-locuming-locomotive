# Thesaurus Engine
#### This is my attempt at a (nonsensical) synonym replacement program — or a *lexical locuming locomotive*, as it likes to call itself.

<br/>
<br/>

The main program is `ThesaurusEngine.py`. I've tried countless methods to pack it into an executable but `lemminflect` seems to disagree with all of them.

Non-standard requisites are: `numpy`,`nltk`, and `lemminflect`. You can `pip install` all of these at the start of the Jupyter file, if you uncomment the relevant lines.

Instructions are given on start, but before running it you have a choice to make:
###### 1) Paste your raw text into `input.txt`. This is useful for larger text.
###### 2) For smaller text (e.g. single sentences), just type/paste directly into the console.

Note that this will **not** fix your spelling, punctuation, or grammar. In fact, these will only be made worse if entered wrong.
