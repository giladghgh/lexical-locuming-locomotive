# Thesaurus Engine
#### This is my attempt at a (nonsensical) synonym replacement program â€” or a *lexical locuming locomotive*, as it likes to call itself.

<br/>
<br/>

The main program is `ThesaurusEngine.py`. Non-standard requisites are: `numpy`,`nltk`, and `lemminflect`. You can `pip install` all of these at the start of the Jupyter file, if you uncomment the relevant lines.

Instructions are given on start, but before running it you have a choice to make:
###### 1) Paste your raw text into `input.txt`. This is useful for larger text.
###### 2) For smaller text (e.g. single sentences), just type/paste directly into the console.

Note that this will **not** fix your spelling, punctuation, or grammar. In fact, these will only be made worse if entered wrong.

The notebook (original file) is somewhat... unpolished, so traverse that with care and read the commenting.
