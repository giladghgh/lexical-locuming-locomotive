# Thesaurus Engine
### This is my attempt at a (nonsensical) synonym replacement program â€” or a *lexical locuming locomotive*, as it likes to call itself.

The main program is `ThesaurusEngine.py`. Before running it though, you have a choice to make:
###### 1) Paste your raw text into `input.txt`. This is useful for larger text.
###### 2) For smaller text (e.g. single sentences), just paste directly into the console.

Note that this will **not** fix your spelling, punctuation, or spelling. In fact, these will only be made worse and may break the output.

The notebook (original file) is a bit less... polished, so traverse that with care and read the commenting.
