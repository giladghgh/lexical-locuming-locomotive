When you run the executable `Thesaurus-Engine.exe`, you have two options:
###### 1) Use the code you've pasted into `input.txt`. To do this enter "file" (no quotes) when prompted for text. This is useful for larger text.
###### 2) For smaller text, just paste directly into the command line when asked.
